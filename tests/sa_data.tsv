0	"Magnesium is a metal inspite of its fully filled sband, because of the availability of the empty Porbitals that make up the Pband which can grow close enough to overlap with some of the sorbitals in the sband and in so doing gives rise to hybridisation. Mixing of bands of the s and p orbitals is responsible for the metal properties exhibited by Mg."

3	"the overlapping pband and sband of Mg metal ensure it has unoccupied energy levels it only takes up 14 of the valence orbitals nSodium has only 1 valence electron in the sorbital and so, it has halffilled sband"
3	" Metals tend to be good electronic conductors, meaning that they have a large number of electrons which are able to access empty mobile energy states within the material.n Sodium has a halffilled sband, so there are a number of empty states immediately above the highest occupied energy levels within the band.n Magnesium has a full sband, but the the sband and pband overlap in magnesium. Thus are still a large number of available energy states immediately above the sband highest occupied energy level."
2	"Sodium behaves as a metal because the electrons in the sband are able to accept energy from an electric field so can move into the unfilled sbands. In the case of Magnesium even though the s band is filled the electrons can still accept energy from an electric field but instead of moving to an unfilled sband it moves to an unfilled pband still enabling it to move around the structure. This gives Magnesium its metallic properties."
3	"All metals tend to conduct electricity as the electrons in the structure can change energy states. Sodium acts as a metal as the sband is only half filled so the electrons can change energy states into the unfilled bands. Magnesium acts as a metal because even though the sband is full the s and p bands overlap so the electrons in the sband can change energy states into the p band allowing them the conduct electricity "

2	"The p orbitals of Mg are very close in energy levels to the s orbitals so the electrons can jump from the s to p orbitals in much the same way that tha Na electrons can move to the upper unfilled s orbitals."
2	"Because the highest filled sband molecular orbital in Mg metal is situated near the empty pband molecular orbital, so electrons need really a little amount of energy to go from one molecular orbital to another. Just like in Na metal."
3	"Both elements have filled unfilled orbitals.nIn Na, electrons can be excited from the highest filled bonding s orbitals Valence bands into the lowest unfilled s orbitals antibonding u2013 Conduction bands.nIn Mg, the 3s 3p valence orbitals interact much more strongly with each other than with the filled core shells the Valence bands have a large band width u2013 so large, in fact, that the band width is wider than the energy gap the bands overlap. Thus it requires only a small amount of energy to excite an electron from a filled s orbital s band into an unfilled p orbital p band. This electron can then migrate through the crystal in response to an applied electric field thus conduct electricity.n"
3	"Metallic behavior can arise either from the presence of a single partially filled band or from two overlapping bands one full and one empty."

1	"The electrons at the top of the filled sband in Mg can move into the empty pband."
3	"First, we will define a metal as being a good conductor of electricity, that is, a material where the electric charges move through easily. We know that the mobile charges are the electrons.nIn order for a solid to be a good conductor, the electrons need to dispose of empty extended molecular orbitals to which they can access with the small amounts of energy that are provided by an external applied electric field the electrons move then through these extended orbitals.nIn the case of Na atomic structure Ne 3s1, the system presents an sband, that is, a u201ccontinuousu201d bundle of extended molecular orbitals, which in this case is half filled. In this way, when an electric field is applied to the system, the electrons placed in the upper occupied band levels of the sband take the transferred energy and move to band levels with slightly higher energy, and then they move through the extended molecular levels linked with these band levels.nIn the case of Mg Ne 3s2, the sband is completely filled, so there is no possibility of transitions inside this band. However, the p atomic orbitals of Mg form a pband which overlaps with the sband, in such a way that the electrons in the upper part of the sband can jump to the pband with the amounts of energy provided by the applied electric field, and move through the pband extended molecular orbitals."
1	"The upper sband orbitals of magnesium have pband orbitals close to them. So the electrons can move to the porbitals accepting energy of the electric field."
2	"The electronic configuration of magnesium is 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2. In this structure it appears that all the energy bands, 1s, 2s, 2p and 3s are completely filled, thus not satisfying the metallic feature according to band theory, however the magnesium is a metal.

3	"In both cases, there are electrons whose energy levels are located such that there is another energy level only a little bit above them, thus allowing them to absorb the tiny amount of energy imparted by an electric field in the presence of collisions."
2	"As these two bands overlape they become free electrons and act as conductors.rising levels of these electrons acquire an additional energy which enables them to move higher to unaccupied levels,transforming into kentic energy.thus behaving as metals."
3	"The sband is complete in the Mg because the Mg has two electrons of valence and the sband of Na only has one electron.nnThe electrons in the Na, can move in the sband but the electrons in the Mg only can move to pband."
2	"Na is a metal based on the previous lecture. Mg is a metal because the p and s bands overlap so electrons from the full sband can move into the pband with no energy barrier. Once in the pband, the Mg electrons are free to conduct by gaining minute amounts of energy from the electric field."
2	"The sband of Magnesium is filled because it has double electrons than Na.nMagnesium is metal because the electrons closed to the filled boundary can move to the pband."
2	"This is because the energy levels between the molecular orbital s band and the p band are very close to each other. And therefore any disturbance caused by an electric field is felt by the electrons present in these bands, who respond to this stimulus moving between spaces available."

3	"sodium behaves as metal because electrons can move from one molecular orbital to another molecular orbital in sband , thus allowing conduction . in case of magnesium the energy gap between sband and pband is very low , so even though the sband is filled conduction occurs by movement of electrons from sband to pband , thus magnesium also behaves as metal."
3	"Because, the electrons at the top energy level are able to move to a empty level which has a higher energy. For sodium, its s band is not full so for some electrons they can get energy to another higher level. As for magnesium, although the sband is filled, the pband has the near energy, or in other words, the two energy band have intersect. So the electrons at the sband can get energy and move to the pband.nFrom the analysis above, we can see that both sodium and magnesium behave as metals"

2	"The pband of magnesium is so close to the sband they actually overlap that it takes nearly no energy to excite an electron into the pband. Therefore, electrons near the pband can accept energies that are released from colliding with nuclei and can be accelerated by an electric field. Also, they can absorb light of many different wavelengths and reemitt light of many different wavelengths, giving the metal its shiny appearance."

And Na have only sband, but Mg can have s and pbands together.n Electrons from Na and Mg crystals can be cut of easy from sband and pband."
1	"It is obvious that the magnesiums pband orbitals overlap with the sband. This provides the possibility for the electrons from the sband to diffuse into higher energy orbitals, thus every metal atom with nearly energetically allocated other types of bands can behave as metal conduct current."
2	"Thats because the pband of magnesium is close to its sband and nottaken such that the electrons from the latter can move into the pband when electric field is applied."
2	"Both sodium and magnesium behave as metals, even though the sband of magnesium is filled because the 3p orbitals of magnesium, while empty in an single atom, expand into a band that overlaps the 3s band. As magnesium atoms push together, the electrons initially enter the 3s band, but ultimately the highest energy electrons in the 3s band spill over into the lower energy levels in the 3p band. Sodium, instead, behaves as a metal due to the half filled 3s band that forms the cohesive energy."
2	"Sodiums electrons can move because sband is halffilled. Mg has an overlap between pband and sband, so that electrons have access to the higher energy state from sband to pband."
2	"The sband of Mg is filled with electrons 3s2. However, the s and p band energies have started to overlap.Electrons from the upper energy levels of the sband can jump into the pband and have freedom to move. As they can move about they can behave as a metal and conduct electricity."
2	"electron configuration of Mg is Ne3s2.and we know tow energy levels 3s and 3p are close. however sbanding is filled, as schematic diagram shows sband and pband over lap energy, so electrons can change energy easily and get pband which is empty. in fact, Mg has conductive band .as result of it, Mg behave a metal.nn Na has an electron configuration Ne 3s1 so half of s shell is occupied. the schematic diagram shows just half of sband is filled therefor Na has conductive band and electrons have opportunity to change energy easily. because they dont a lot of energy so, it is a good electron conductor.

3	"Part of the bonding region in the pband of Magnesium is around the same energy as part of the antibonding region of the sband. The sband of Magnesium is completely filled, while the pband is completely empty. Therefore, electrons in the s subshell can accept energy and transfer into the p subshell. This allows for conductivity and Magnesium behaves like a metal. Sodium behaves like a metal because of energy transfer within the s subshell that occur between the bonding and antibonding band regions."

3	"For a material to behave as a metal or exhibit properties of a metal, it is required to have an empty band of molecular orbitals with slightly higher energy. This is because, the properties of a metal are on account of the existence of free electrons within the structure. Now, In sodium metal, the band of molecular orbitals formed is from the 2s atomic orbitals only. This band is halffilled, and as a result, the electrons with the energies equivalent to or just equivalent to the level of the halffilled band can be excited and sent to the unfilled half part of the band. However, in case of Magnesium metal, in spite of both the electrons in a single atom of Magnesium being in the 2s atomic orbital, the molecular orbitals band is formed from the 2s as well as the empty 2p atomic orbitals. The electrons completely fill up the s part of the band, but the p part remains unfilled. This facilitates for some of the electrons to be excited and sent to a higher energy band, where they can be free to some extent. It is this availability of the empty part in the band of molecular orbitals, and thus of electrons to be able to excite, that enables Magnesium metal also to behave as a metal, justlike Sodium. "
2	"In Mg metal electrons from the filled sband can move into the lower levels of the empty pband, as its energy level overlaps with the top of the sband. This movement of electrons in energy bands allows the metallic behaviour. "
3	"According to Aufbaus principle, the lowest energy states of the band are filled first and the upper states remain empty u2013 but can readily be occupied by electrons upon thermal excitation or the application of an electric field. In other words, to be a metal, it requires some of the electrons in the electronic structure to have access to empty states very close to the top of this filled boundary. nHowever, in the case of Magnesium where the sband is filled, there is the pband for electrons to move to. There are unoccupied orbitals just on top of the 3sband which is the 3pband. As the sband and pband meet, they mix therefore giving electrons enough space to roam."
2	"Because there is an overlap between the S band and the P band. Thus, it is possible for the electrons to get excited into the p band in the magnesium metal."

2	"Sodium is located in one family and this group all elements are metals, are excellent conductors of electricity, soft and highly reactive. Have outermost electron in an electron weakly bonded to the core and generally forms univalent compounds, ionic and colorless. He has one valence electron in the outermost orbital s an electron, which occupies a spherical orbital. Ignoring the internal filled electron shell, their electronic configurations can be written as 2s1. The valence electron is quite removed from the core. Thus, the core is loosely bound and can be removed with ease. In contrast, the remaining electrons are closer to the core are more firmly attached and removed with difficulty. At room temperature adopt the bodycentered cubic structure, with coordination number 8.nNow magnesium is less reactive than sodium. he is bivalent and form colorless ionic compounds, have two electrons in the outermost electron level is a strong reducing agent, the fact that it has two electrons in the outer shell gives a distinctive feature to the metal."
2	"Magnesium behaves as metal even though the sband is filled because the pband is close in energy to the sband, so the electrons in the higher energy orbitals of the sband can move to the pband."
2	"This is because the magnesium metal has low energy empty orbitals of the pi band that can accept electron density form the s band orbitals. This is, even though the s band is full, Mg metal can donate electrons to the p band and be modifyed by an electric field as any other metal with empty s band orbitals."
2	"Magnesium can behave as a metal since, though to 3s subshell is full, the 3p subshell is not, and so electrons can jump to those orbitals and move freely. Thus magnesium can also display metallic properties, despite having a filled outermost orbital."

2	"Magnesium behaves as metal, because the filled sband and the empty pband overlap. The pband in Magnesium is partially filled. "
1	"This effect is due to the fact that in the magnesium metal, even though the sband is completely filled, the pband is empty and close enough in energy that the electron, when supplied energy, will jump from the sband to the pband."
2	"Na only half of the sband is filled with e. With little energy gaining by an Efield, for example some e can reach empty sorbitals and travel around the cristal.nnMg the whole sband is filled with e. But the free pband overlaps on the energyscale and so some e can occupy pbandorbitals and freeing sbandorbitals and lowering the overall energy of the cristal. Now, with little energy gaining by an Efield, for example some e can reach empty s and porbitals and travel around the cristal."
3	" The explanation is that, since 3p and 3s valence orbitals of adjacent atoms are farther from their nucleus, their interaction is stronger than that of filled inner orbitals in the core. This results in valence bands to have a larger bandwidth causing 3s and 3p orbitals to overlap and the energy gap between them to disappear. The consequence is that a new band with a total capacity of eight electrons is obtained.n This way Nas band and Mgs band, both formed by delocalized orbitals, are partially filled 18th and 14th respectively and comply with the two requisites to behave as a metal."

2	"Magnesium is a metal with the structure 1su00b2 2su00b2 2pu2076 3su00b2. For the quantum orbits with n3 it seems to be that the upper part of the 3s band created by all the atoms together in the solid overlaps with the lower part of its 3p band. That overlapping makes possible for eu207b to jump to the 3p as it was the conduction band empty of eu207b, with the result that it behaves like the antibonding band of the Sodium. In that way eu207b can travel through the valence band upper 3s band to the conduction band lower 3p band and the Mg behaves as a metal element. That implies the possibility to transmit a current through Mg and its metal behaviour."

1	"The molecular orbitals of Magnesium can be formed by both s and p orbitals i.e, s and p orbitals can hybridize because they are close in energy. Thus Magnesium will also have partially filled band and can behave as a metal."
1	"In the magnesium, the sband and the pband overlap. Electrons are able to move from the sband to the pband the same way electrons are able to move higher in the sband in the sodium. "
1	"Magnesium behave live metal because have empty orbitals in the pband that are closely the boundary filled orbitals of the sband. That way, the electrons of that boundary orbitals, can easily be influenced by the electric field."
2	"By linear combination of atomic orbitals LCAO to determine the MO state, we obtain the number of electronic states depends on the chain of atoms within upper and lower limit an energy band. According to the Pauli principle, the electronic states orbitals within an energy band are filled progressively by pairs of electron.nWe can see that each 3s state of valence shell in the Na atoms is halffilled 3s1 while Mg atoms is doubly occupied 3s2 therefore the sband of Na will be halffilled and sband of Mg is filled actually there is a partially overlap of the 3s and 3p."

1	"Even though the sband of magnesium is filled, pband has plenty of empty orbitals, and there is no gap between the s and pbands, therefore electrons can behave in the same way, leading to metallic behavior."
3	"Sodium behaves as metal, because it has a half filled sbandwith and enough free electronic states to which electrons can be excited by an electric field. In Magnesium the sband is completely filled. But since the sband overlaps with the pband, the small amount of energy supplied by an electric field is sufficient to excite selectrons to electronic states in the empty pband. So also magnesium is metallic. Just as in sodium, an electric field can induce an electric current."
