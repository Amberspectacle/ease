in order to replicate this experiment , i would need to know additional information such as the four different samples that they used because i could have choosen metal , carbboard and many other sample materials that they didn't use and would get different results . also i would also need to know the amount of vinegar to pour because this can caute a major change . lastly , they might want to tell where to sit the samples while they dry for minutes because if they are sitting in room temp . or by a light source makes a difference too .
